# Independent Contractor Incentive Plan

## Purpose
[%Grantor] offers [%Beneficiary] participation in an incentive Plan on the terms and conditions set forth below.

a) The purpose of the Plan is to serve as an instrument to [%Grantor] to attract and retain the best contributors. 
b) In the case of those key contributors which are legal entities, the status of Beneficiary is granted to the natural persons effectively providing the services to Grantor on behalf of these companies, to the extent there is a contract which links such natural person with the provision of the services.
c) This Plan is based on and sets forth the rules for the distribution of Tokens.
d) The Tokens obtained by the Beneficiaries based on this Plan do not grant their holder the status or rights of a shareholder of Grantor, or any voting or economic rights inherent to such condition/status. 

## Mechanism
a) The Plan shall entitle Beneficiary to receive from Grantor, upon the lapse of a certain time, the Incentive.
b) In proof of his acceptance to participate in the Plan, the Beneficiary shall deliver to Grantor a countersigned copy of this document. The countersignature of this document by the Beneficiary shall entail its acceptance of each and every one of the terms and conditions set forth in this Plan. 
c) In case the Beneficiary fails to return the duly countersigned Plan, the Beneficiary shall be deemed having waived his rights to participate in the Plan and to acquire Tokens under such Plan.

## Amount and Granting Date
a) Beneficiary shall receive [%Tokens].
b) Granting Date shall be [%Granting Date].
c) Vested Tokens shall be granted to [%Beneficiary Ethereum Address].

## Vesting Period
The vesting period shall be of [%Total Vesting Period] from [%Granting Date], during which the Incentive shall vest for the Beneficiary if the conditions of the Plan are met.

In this regard, the Incentive shall vest as follows: 

a) After [%Cliff Period], 25% of the Incentive shall vest. 
b) Following the Cliff Period the remaining Incentive shall vest linearly per block in Ethereum during the following [%Linear Vesting Period]. 
c) Consequently, at the end of the referred Total Vesting Period, the Incentive shall have completely vested and the Vesting Contract shall release any remaining Tokens to the respective Beneficiary. 
d) The Beneficiary shall acquire the ownership of the corresponding vested Tokens when triggering the release function in the Vesting Contract. For the avoidance of doubt, and solely for civil law purposes, the non-released Tokens are and remain in the ownership of Grantor. 
e) Grantor may at any time grant already vested Tokens and/or an accelerated vesting right to a Beneficiary in relation to a part or all of the Incentives of such Beneficiary pending to be vested.

## Loss of the Condition of Beneficiary
a) A Beneficiary shall lose his status of Beneficiary with immediate effect in case of termination of the contractors agreement between Grantor and Beneficiary.
b) Furthermore, in the case of those key contributors which are legal entities and the status of Beneficiary has been granted to the natural persons effectively providing the services to Grantor on behalf of these companies, the Beneficiary shall also lose all non-vested Tokens with immediate effect upon the termination of the contractor agreement between Grantor and Beneficiary.
c) Upon losing the status as Beneficiary, such Beneficiary shall lose his right to receive any further Incentive under the Plan with immediate effect, and the corresponding Vesting Contract shall no longer continue to be linked to the Beneficiary. 

## Smart Contract
a) As from [%Cliff Date], the Incentive to be granted to Beneficiary shall be subject to the terms of Vesting Contract. 
b) In case of conflict between the terms of the Vesting Contract and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall prevail against the terms of the Vesting Contract.
c) In case every and all requirements set forth in the General Conditions of the Plan are met, the Vesting Contract shall release the vested Tokens and the Beneficiary shall then claim his already unlocked tokens by interacting with the Vesting Contract and calling the release function, which is already at his disposal. Upon such call, the Vesting Contract will transfer the already vested tokens to Beneficiary Ethereum Address. 
d) Upon the loss of the status of Beneficiary, the corresponding Vesting Contract shall no longer continue to allow the Beneficiary to release tokens, and the non-vested Tokens shall be released in favor of Grantor. 

## Acknowledgment
a) The Beneficiary acknowledges that the Tokens acquired based on the Plan shall not be understood as compensation for his work(s) rendered to Grantor. Therefore, the Incentive shall not be considered compensation in case of dismissal or termination of any contractual agreement/provision of services, as extraordinary bonuses, retirement pension or compensation, or any other payment, compensation or indemnification due on the basis of the terms and conditions of their professional relationship with Grantor. 
b) Likewise, the Beneficiary acknowledges that the Incentive subject to this Plan shall not be accumulated or consolidated with any remuneration for services and thus, it is granted to certain key contributors on the sole discretion of Grantor.

## Assignment
No Party is entitled to assign, pledge, hypothecate (or otherwise create any lien on) any rights under the Plan to any third party without the prior written consent of the other Party. No consent is required in case of a transfer of vested Tokens. 

## Taxation
a) Any taxes that might arise in connection with the grant, acquisition, holding and sale of the Tokens, respectively by the Beneficiary, shall be on the account of Beneficiary. 
b) Any social security contributions due in connection with the grant, acquisition, holding and sale of the Tokens, respectively by the Beneficiary, shall be on the account of Beneficiary insofar as the applicable law so provides. 
c) To the extent the grant, acquisition, holding and sale of the Tokens, respectively by the Beneficiary, is subject to source tax and/or social security contributions, Grantor has the right to make the legally required deductions. If no deductions can be made, the Beneficiary shall be obliged to hold Grantor harmless for any taxes and/or social security contributions owed by the Beneficiary. 

## Notices
a) Any notification or communication to Beneficiary shall be sent to [%Beneficiary Email Address].
b) Any notification or communication to Grantor shall be sent to [%Grantor Email Address]. 

## Severability
If any provision of this Plan becomes invalid, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions. Any invalid provisions shall be replaced by valid provisions which economically and materially achieve to the greatest extent possible the same effect as the invalid provisions.

## Gender Neutrality
Words in the singular mean and include the plural and vice versa. Words in the masculine mean and include the feminine and vice versa.
